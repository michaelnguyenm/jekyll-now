title: Week 8 - A New Project
---

**What did you do this past week?**

I attempted to update my tablet to Windows 10 Anniversary (which was having problems already) which required making a boot USB on my desktop that has very little space left on the system hard drive. I used the [disk cleanup tool provided by windows and proceeded to completely break my Windows installation](https://jakekuyser.wordpress.com/2015/11/27/ctrl-alt-hell-windows-7-disk-cleanup-killed-my-pc/) and I had to use my last device, my laptop, to troubleshoot everything. That made last week a boring and non-productive week, migrating files and installing Windows 10 Anniversary on everything.

**What's in your way?**


**What will you do next week?**

As my computers are now fixed, and they are the systems I prefer to develop on, I will now finish the project we were assigned! I've also began to do HackerRank problems as suggested by many people in the class and my interview practice friends.
