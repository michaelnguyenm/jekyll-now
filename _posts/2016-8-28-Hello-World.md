**What did you do this past week?**

This past week has been a struggle with moving back into my apartment. It's been nearly 5 months since I had seen the place, and as expected, it wasn't taken care of very well by my roommates. Given that I'm a computer science major and of course, the difficulties associated with the kind of people within the major (introvertism, etc), it really wasn't easy to approach the problem. However, if I had put off addressing the mess that they left and that I cleaned up by myself when I got back, I definitely would not have had a very happy semester. Really, the difficulty is just all within my head, so I just gathered up all my roommates and told them the huge list of messes that were left behind, from expired food to the greasy stove top, and tried to provide solutions on how to remember to clean your own mess. They took it surprisingly well. They understood that I was the kind of person that wouldn't normally approach a problem in this manner so they were patient with me.

Beyond that, I helped set up a friend's internet subscription, modem, and wi-fi for the first time which was an interesting experience. It seems that even though Time Warner Cable has a webportal for activating the internet, it may not always work, so we had to call up customer support to activate it.

**What's in your way?**

Having been studying abroad in Tokyo for the past 4 or so months, I can definitely say I'm still struggling now that I'm back in the states. The biggest worry for me is that I haven’t been coding anything for that period of time. I wish I could say it’s like riding a bicycle. In that time, my Japanese certainly did improve, but my C and Java knowledge definitely deteriorated. Aside from that, the kind of life I had in Tokyo was very different from here. The most obvious one is I didn’t spend too much time in front of the monitor.  The second problem is thinking of what to do with the camera that I bought for the purpose of taking pictures in Japan at this point in time.

What will you do next week?

I definitely know that at the end of the week, I will be going to an event in San Antonio called San Japan. I really can’t wait to see some more amazing cosplay, artwork, and the concert performance by ROOKiEZ is PUNK’D.
