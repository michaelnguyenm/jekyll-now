title: Week 1 - Stepping into the Class
---

**What did you do this past week?**

This past week has been a struggle with moving back into my apartment. It's been nearly 5 months since I had seen the place, and as expected, it wasn't taken care of very well by my roommates. Given that I'm a computer science major and of course, the difficulties associated with the kind of people within the major (introvertism, etc), it really wasn't easy to approach the problem. However, if I had put off addressing the mess that they left, I definitely would not have had a very happy semester. Really, the difficulty is just all within my head, so I just gathered up all my roommates and told them the huge list of messes that were left behind, from expired food to the greasy stove top, and tried to provide solutions on how to remember to clean their own mess. They took it surprisingly well. They understood that I was the kind of person that wouldn't normally approach a problem in this manner, so they were patient with me.

Beyond that, I helped set up a friend's internet subscription, modem, and wi-fi for the first time which was an interesting experience. It seems that even though Time Warner Cable has a webportal for activating the internet, it may not always work, so we had to call up customer support to activate it.

**What's in your way?**

Having been studying abroad in Tokyo for the past 4 or so months, I can definitely say I'm still struggling now that I'm back in the states. The biggest worry for me is that I haven’t been coding anything for that period of time. I really wish I could say it’s like riding a bicycle. In that time, my Japanese certainly did improve, but my C and Java knowledge definitely deteriorated. Aside from that, the kind of life I had in Tokyo was very different from here. The most obvious one is I didn’t spend too much time in front of the monitor. The second problem is thinking of what to do with the camera that I bought for the purpose of taking pictures in Japan at this point in time as the trains really let me get to a variety of places in a very timely manner. I can't say the same for buses in Austin.

**What will you do next week?**

I definitely know that at the end of the week, I will be going to an event in San Antonio called San Japan. I really can’t wait to see some more amazing cosplay, artwork, and the concert performance by ROOKiEZ is PUNK’D.

**The Class**

In class, we began with some basic differences between C++ and Java such as #include/using in C++ and #import in Java. We also learned through example as to why assert doesn't make for a great unit tester which is why we will be using Google Test. I found that it was nice that Dr. Downing posted those notes after class, although the only way for me to organize them neatly is to probably rewrite them as annotations to the notes he posts. 

What stuck out to me the most like most people was that Dr. Downing would call on random people to answer question. For me, it keeps me more attentive in class which I'd say is a plus. This is also the first class where I'll be actively using GitHub as well as using a number of other tools such as Docker and Travis CI in addition to a text editor/IDE and compiler. I do appreciate that there's a class that urges us to use new tools and GitHub in order to prepare us for the workplace.

**Tip-of-the-Week**

I've had Ubuntu installed on my laptop for some time and have used it in previous classes. However, I wanted to install Docker on my Windows 7 PC which... Didn't go so well. In fact, I would have to use Docker Toolbox rather than what is probably the newest version of Docker. To be honest, while PowerShell is miles ahead of the command line, I'm still not used to it at all compared to Bash. I gave up and installed Docker on my laptop, and will probably try another day. I'm convinced that just installing Docker on Linux is just easier, but maybe someone had a better time (maybe with Windows 10).
