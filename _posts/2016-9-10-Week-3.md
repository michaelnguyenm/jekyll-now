**What did you do this past week?**

I finished the Collatz project just in the neck of time after the hectic weekend I had before that didn't allow me to get any work done. What I was most impressed by was how I carefully planned the meta caching optimization out paper and managed to code it right the first time and passing all the tests. Writing python scripts to also parse data and create the cache in the form of an array was also pretty fun. I'd love to spend more time writing in python to be honest.

**What's in your way?**

After the last quiz, I can definitely say I need to brush up on references and pointers since it's been so long. Other than that, there's nothing in the way until the next project is out.

**What will you do next week?**

At this point in time, I should be preparing for the career fair that's coming up next. I need to update my resume and references for that.
